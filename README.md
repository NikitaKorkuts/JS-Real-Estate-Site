# JS-Real-Estate-Site
This site is written in native JavaScript. Its sends fetch request to fake online REST API server, which works as json database. Database has three houses, you can switch houses on the site by sliding. On the site I made slider using slick.js, gallery using lightbox.js and add google map with house location.
